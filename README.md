# What Should I Eat? App

## User Stories
* A freezer/fridge/pantry inventory app. Where you can add items (in portions), set a “use by” date, remove portions, filter/sort/search and get notifications when things are close to expiring.
* To solve the issue of waste, overspending,  and to assist with portion sizing. 
* So if you have 12 breasts in the freezer, it should say "eat 1 chicken breast this week".

## Future User Stories
* As a user, I would like to be able to use this app from any device, so I can not loose my data if I reset my computer.
